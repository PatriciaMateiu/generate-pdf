A prominent figure in Buddhist and Egyptian culture, and native flower for both India and Vietnam, the lotus holds enormous symbolic weight. 
It spans various thousand-year-old Eastern cultures and yet, is still considered one of the most sacred flowers today. 
So what is it about this mysterious blossom that people find so enrapturing? 
Its colorful bloom is an obvious suspect, but the lotus also has a life cycle unlike any other. 
With its roots based in mud, it submerges every night into murky river water, and—undeterred by its dirty environment—it miraculously re-blooms the next morning without residue on its petals.
